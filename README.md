# AutoProof

A blockchain-powered platform for transparent supply management in automotive manufacturing, addressing real-world issues like counterfeit parts, inefficient recalls, supply disruptions, and lack of visibility into component origins — all on-chain using Clarity for secure, Bitcoin-anchored smart contracts.

---

## Overview

AutoProof consists of four main smart contracts that together form a decentralized, transparent, and efficient ecosystem for automotive manufacturers, suppliers, and regulators:

1. **Parts Registry Contract** – Registers and manages unique identifiers for automotive parts as NFTs.
2. **Supply Tracker Contract** – Logs and verifies the movement of parts through the supply flow.
3. **Quality Assurance Contract** – Handles inspections, compliance checks, and oracle-integrated data verification.
4. **Recall Manager Contract** – Automates recall processes, warranty claims, and stakeholder notifications.

---

## Features

- **NFT-based part registration** for anti-counterfeiting and provenance tracking  
- **Immutable supply logs** for real-time visibility and auditability  
- **Automated quality checks** with off-chain oracle integration for inspections and certifications  
- **Efficient recall management** with targeted notifications and compensation distribution  
- **Transparent stakeholder access** for manufacturers, suppliers, and regulators  
- **Reduced fraud and waste** by ensuring authentic parts and streamlined processes

## Smart Contracts

### Parts Registry Contract
- Mint NFTs for individual automotive parts with metadata (e.g., serial number, manufacturer, specs)
- Transfer ownership during supply handoffs
- Burn or update NFTs for end-of-life or recycled parts

### Supply Tracker Contract
- Log part movements (e.g., from supplier to assembly line) with timestamps and signatures
- Verify custody flow to prevent tampering
- Query historical records for audits or disputes

### Quality Assurance Contract
- Integrate with oracles for real-world data (e.g., inspection results, material certifications)
- Enforce compliance rules before advancing parts in the flow
- Flag and quarantine non-compliant items automatically

### Recall Manager Contract
- Initiate recalls based on defect reports or oracle alerts
- Notify affected parties (e.g., owners, dealers) via on-chain events
- Distribute compensations or refunds from a locked treasury
